# Face_recognition_attendance_system
The objective of this project is to design and implement an automated face recognition-based attendance management system that leverages machine learning techniques for real-time identification of registered users, records attendance with high accuracy, prevents proxy entries, and securely stores attendance logs in a database. 

## Key Features:

- **Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition**  
  Uses **OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier** for fast and accurate face detection, matched with **LBPH** for precise recognition.

- **Dataset Generation & Preprocessing**  
  Captures multiple images per user from various angles and lighting, and applies techniques like grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization for uniformity.

- **Automatic Attendance Logging**  
  Logs attendance in a **MySQL database**, capturing the user's details such as date, time, and ID, while preventing duplicate entries.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  A simple **Tkinter GUI** allows users to easily interact with the system and receive real-time feedback on their attendance status.

- **Secure Data Storage**  
  **MySQL** securely stores attendance data, allowing easy retrieval and ensuring data integrity.

## Where It Applies:

This system is ideal for environments where accurate and efficient attendance management is crucial:

- **Educational Institutions**  
  Automates student attendance in classrooms or during online sessions.

- **Workplaces**  
  Enhances employee attendance monitoring for better time management.

- **Event Management**  
  Facilitates attendee tracking at conferences, workshops, and seminars.

## Future Enhancements:
- Integration of **Deep Learning Models** (e.g., CNNs) for improved recognition accuracy.
- Addition of **Emotion Recognition** and enhanced **security measures** for more comprehensive systems.
- Improved **scalability** to cater to larger organizations and environments.
